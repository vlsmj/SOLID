# SOLID
A basic sample project following SOLID principles.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (known as SRP)** - states that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program.
- **Open/Closed Principle** - Open-closed Principle (OCP) states: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
- **Interface Segregation Principle** - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that a client should not be exposed to methods it doesn't need.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
